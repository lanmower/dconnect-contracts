         <p>A blockchain has launched called <strong>FreedomFirst</strong>, its primary purpose is to run a world class distributed dapp network.</p>
         <h2>
            <a id="user-content-what-is-the-purpose-of-freedomfirst" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="https://github.com/lanmower/freedomfirst#what-is-the-purpose-of-freedomfirst">

         </h2>
         <h2>What is the purpose of <strong>FreedomFirst</strong>?</h2>
         <p><strong>FreedomFirst</strong> picks up from the lessons learned on 
            STEEM, Ethereum, EOS, and other large blockchains. STEEM allowed us all 
            to blog in a distributed way, which exposed a lot of people to the 
            potential of blockchain technology for hosting content.
         </p>
         <p>Applications that utilize blockchains, together with other hosting 
            technologies like traditional file hosting, or distributed hosting like 
            IPFS, have recently appeared. Providing a clearer perspective on what is
            required of good distributed hosting.
         </p>
         <p>Therefore, the initial focus of our project will be to provide 
            formalized mechanisms for hosting decentralized applications and their 
            content.
         </p>
         <p>Tokens are an important aspect of how autonomous communities and 
            smart companies organize themselves. The hybrid approach between hosting
            content and being able to create tokens creates a perfect environment 
            for applications.
         </p>
         <p><strong>FreedomFirst</strong> is started without an ICO or corporate 
            ties. It is a truly decentral, community-governed endeavour where the 
            focus is on utility from the start.

         </h2>
         <h2>What kind of problems do previous networks experience?</h2>
         <p>Creating or operating tokens is usually expensive or unavailable.
            Customization of server behavior is often not available.
            Valued content, if falling on distributed hosting,  often disappears 
            from the  network, and there is no easy way to stop it from happening on
            current systems.
            Without customizable storage and server behavior, content unrelated to 
            specific applications can spill over from other ones.
            The ability to edit published content can be either difficult to design,
            or doesn’t work well in  practice.
            Storage of content is fragmented on current networks, applications don’t
            share a formal storage mechanism.
            Development a huge undertaking, and currently require hosts that 
            resemble classical centralized websites, and also require extensive 
            knowledge of the network(s) that they exist on.
            It is impossible for ordinary people to take part in the hosting of the 
            existing popular networks because of huge corporate stakes.

         </h2>
         <h2>How does <strong>FreedomFirst</strong> solve this?</h2>
         <p><strong>FreedomFirst</strong> runs on the EOSIO blockchain software, 
            since it’s the fastest and most customizable blockchain around. From the
            very start, the issues of token creation and custom server operations 
            are solved.
         </p>
         <p>When storing information, <strong>FreedomFirst</strong> uses smart 
            contracts to index IPFS hashes. IPFS provides seamless data storage and 
            distribution mechanisms, but it doesn’t provide addressing and indexing.
            A smart contract provides a good mechanism to index information. IPFS, 
            unlike direct blockchain storage, provides a way to store content of any
            size and any format. This allows apps to store their source data, as 
            well as their content.
         </p>
         <p>The smart contracts provide records of each upload, which is used for
            searching as well as for tracking long term storage. Apps can track 
            their own content, users can track their own content, and paid services 
            can be established.
         </p>
         <p>The idea being to distribute all aspects of storing information, so 
            that users are not solely dependent on their providers to store their 
            data, and facing the potential loss thereof.
         </p>

         <p>On the web, <strong>dConnect</strong> behaves like a classical web-server, you can host any content on it.
            On app stores, <strong>dConnect</strong> will get an app through which you can access any dapp on the network, and you will have a bar for your favorites.

            Storage mechanisms have been rolled out to keep content online.
         </p>
         <p>The mechanisms for storing and erasing information has been written and is being tested.</p>
         <p>We have rolled out some early apps to help on-board members, check out the info at the end of the paper.</p>

         <p>An ecosystem of apps will emerge, being hosted on dconnect, and 
            storing their posts and information using variations of the same storage
            technique. We’re focusing on using these techniques to create a few 
            important community apps, initially we’ll be working on:
         </p>
         <p>Formalized API/toolkit for app creation
            Homepage creation/CMS
            Blogging
