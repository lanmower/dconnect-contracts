This will be a tutorial to show how we can edit 
this website with glitch, then by pressing space
in the server.js file, evertything in "public/" 
folder will be stored on IPFS and indexed with the
FreedomFirst EOS based blockchain.

The .env file stores the account name, private key, 
and the name that will be used to generate a 
subdomain on https://dconnect.live 


We will edit the text "Sign Up" to "Sign Up Now!" 
and show the log file of the server executing
the tasks with IPFS as well as FreedomFirst.

  Thanks for watching!
